  ### Welcome to my GitHub profile

  Java developer, currently learning game design to elevate my skills, and possibly to create my first game (maybe even publicizing it on itch.io)

  I like music, art, really like creating my own drawings and playing my favorite video-games

  ***Programming languages i currently know (or currently learning)***
  ```
  Java, C, C#, Python, T-SQL, GDScript (godot)
  ```

  ***Tools i currently use***
  ```
  VS Code, Eclipse IDE, DBeaver, Git
  ```

  ***Current plans***
  ```
  so basically, i have two things in mind (excluding the main ones obviously)

  first, i need to improve my front-end programming, i suck at developing
  webpages and such :/

  second, i really want to start making my own games, so im learning
  how to use godot, a FOSS game engine and a great alternative
  to unity (my first game will probably be a recreation of a sonic game :D)
  ```

  i hope you like my projects, most of them are really small, or made for fun
